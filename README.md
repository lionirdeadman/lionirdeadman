My name is Lionir Deadman but just can just call me Lion for short. My pronouns are he/him/his. Nice to meet you!

I never know what to say honestly. I like anime, tech, philosophy, copyleft? I'm fairly all over the place. One week or month, I'll be talking to you about a certain project all day long and another I'm gonna be into something completely different.
